# Simple-React-Todo-App

1. `npm install`
2. `mongod`
3. `npm run dev`

This will run both the server and your client.
- No need to restart anything during development.
- Changes to files under `/server` will restart your express server.
- Chnages to files under `/src` will rerun webpack (compile sass, minify etc) and refresh the browser.
